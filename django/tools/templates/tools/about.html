                <p class="about">Because of this statistic, we felt it was important for us to create a sort of social media support network
                    for those who experience everything from inappropriate comments in the workplace and at school, to sexual
                    assault.

                    to enter their own zip code, we donâ€™t have to use the location of the user to help them feel more secure.

                <p class="about">Our website has a feed where users can post and comment on the experiences of others. By authenticating a
                    users profile and requiring log-in to post, as well as having a comprehensive report and block feature,
                    we are providing our users with safety. The anonymous posting option also allows users to stay anonymous,
                    however they are promoted to keep specific identifiers out of their posts in case someone involved or
                    someone they know also happens to be on this site, too.</p>

                    we are not the only site that can provide them with the support they require.</p>
